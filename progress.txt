﻿﻿Began developing PGNHandler: now it can parse tag pairs from PGN-file for several parties.
Now it can parse tag pairs and movetext for several parties from one PNG-file.

Began developing classes Party and View. View represents condition of the game at one moment, so party can be represented as a set of view.
Important Party method generateViews() generate views to the party called it according to the moves stored in party.
Now this method can genetate views to only simple moves:
1. Pawn moves (without captures)
2. Knight moves(-//-)
3. Rook moves(-//-)
4. Bishop
5. King
6. Queen

I have refactored my code, so that for every type of piece i have a subclass of class Piece. 
Views are generated for almost every type of move (captures, castling). Its en passant (for pawns) and promotion left. 

I have created my db on server. Started to implement DBHandler (method connect and addParty). 
GUI is ready. Now i will implement it.
