﻿﻿Began developing PGNHandler: now it can parse tag pairs from PGN-file for several parties.
Now it can parse tag pairs and movetext for several parties from one PNG-file.

Began developing classes Party and View. View represents condition of the game at one moment, so party can be represented as a set of view.
Important Party method generateViews() generate views to the party called it according to the moves stored in party.
Now this method can genetate views to only simple moves:
1. Pawn moves (without captures)
2. Knight moves(-//-)

I have refactored my code, so that for every type of piece i have a subclass of class Piece. 
Then i will implement generating views to other type of figures moves. When I'll do it, i will implement captures and finally such special things as castling, en passant (for pawns) and promotion. 

Then I will work on my DBHandler.
Then I will work on my GUI.
